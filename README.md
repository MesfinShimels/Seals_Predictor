 Rossmann Store Sales Prediction Project

 Overview
This project involves building an end-to-end solution to predict daily sales for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals' stores across several cities up to six weeks in advance. The predictions will help Rossmann optimize resource allocation and business planning.

The project incorporates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models, deep learning approaches, and a REST API to serve predictions.

 How to Run the Project

 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: Install dependencies using the command:

  ```bash
  pip install -r api/requirements.txt
  ```

---

 2. Data Preprocessing
- Use `notebook/preprocessing.ipynb` or `scripts/preprocessing.py` to clean and preprocess the data.
- Cleaned data will be saved in the `Cleaned_Data` directory.

---

 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Use `notebook/eda.ipynb` to explore trends and relationships in the dataset.
- Insights will guide model feature selection and tuning.

---

 4. Model Training
- Use `notebook/model_training.ipynb` or extend functionality from `scripts/preprocessing.py`.
- Models are saved in the `models` directory after training.

---

 5. Predictions
- Use `notebook/Prediction.ipynb` or `scripts/prediction.py` to make predictions using the trained models.
- Predictions are saved in the `Findings` directory.

---

 6. Deep Learning
- Use `notebook/deep_learning.ipynb` to implement LSTM-based time-series forecasting.

---

 7. REST API
- Run `api/api.py` to serve predictions via a REST API.

  ```bash
  python api/api.py
  ```
- Access the API endpoints locally for real-time predictions.

---

 Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and outliers effectively.
- Modular Design: Scripts and notebooks are organized for scalability and maintainability.
- Machine Learning: Implements Random Forest Regressor and other algorithms.
- Deep Learning: Integrates LSTM for advanced time-series forecasting.
- API Deployment: Real-time prediction serving through a REST API.

---

 Future Improvements
- Add hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
- Extend API functionalities for better input validation and logging.
- Deploy the project on a cloud platform for scalability.
- Add unit tests in the `tests` directory to ensure reliability.
